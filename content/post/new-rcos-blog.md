Something I'm very exciting about happened recently! We finally have an official
RCOS Blog! This is something we've wanted to get going for a long time, and
finally got around to setting up, thanks to one of our awesome alumni. We have a
lot of valuable knowledge and experience about doing and teaching Open Source,
and I'm really happy that we now have an official channel to share it.

It actually looks really clean too, and is cohesive with the rest of our
documentation. I'm starting to see why [branding
guidelines](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/resources/brand_standards) are so
important. Now if only I had the time to make some for Yacs...

Anyway, I wrote a post kicking off our Summer Session, and I plan on making more
posts there over the coming months as a part of my knowledge dumping efforts.
I'll probably do a few cross posts between the RCOS blog and my personal blog,
or post modified versions of posts designated for one to the other.

So go check out [the blog](https://blog.rcos.io/) and [my recent
post](https://blog.rcos.io/2018/summer-of-rcos/)!

Until next time,

Ada
