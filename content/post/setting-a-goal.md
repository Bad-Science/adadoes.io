It's been three weeks since I graduated from RPI. I've had some time to relax and collect myself, which was something I really needed and has definitely been good for my mental health.

However, I've come to find that I get anxious very quickly if I don't feel like I am accomplishing something! So I really want to use this time to learn how to maximize my productivity, and in turn maximize my general happiness.

So, I've been putting a lot of thought into what I want to achieve over the next few years, what is really important to me, and how I want to spend my time. I've also been thinking a lot about how I could have done better in school, and how I can do better in the future in whatever I set out to do.

I've been expirimenting with some different goal setting and tracking methods, which I will be writing about in an upcoming series of posts. But starting right now, I'm setting a slightly simpler goal. To fill this graph:

![Contributions June 2018](/post/setting-a-goal/graph-june-2018.png)

This something I've really wanted to do for a long time. And not just for vanity or to impress people who pass by my GitHub profile. This is part of a larger effort to become a more active open source contributor, and someday be a prominent member of the community. Filling up the graph is simply a concrete, measurable way to help me stay on track.

So by June 1st, 2019, my goal is to have my contributions graph entirely full, with, let's say 1000 total contributions. Wish me luck!!!

Until next time,

Ada
