Hello, World!

I'm Ada, and this is my blog!

A little about me: I'm a software developer, teacher, maker, tinkerer, open
source evangelist, and lots of other things! I'm currently a senior coordinator
at [RCOS](rcos.io), the Rensselaer Center for Open Source, which is where I
spend most of my time. I love teaching and learning from my peers, developing
curriculum, giving talks, and maintaining my open source project,
[Yacs](github.com/yacs-rcos/yacs). I'm also involved with
[MOSSN](https://opensource.mozilla.community/), the Mozilla Open Source Student
Network, where I work with and advise other campus clubs from around the
country! I'm graduating college very soon, so soon I'll have a lot more time to
focus on the things I love!

I also love writing and sharing, but I haven't been doing enough of it! So I
made this blog to write about what I'm working on, post guides, opinions, my
favorite one-liners, and whatever else I can think of! So check back soon for
some great content!

\- Ada
